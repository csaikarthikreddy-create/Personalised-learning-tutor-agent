    "# Chiron - A Feynman-Enhanced Learning Agent Using LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook presents a structured learning agent implemented using LangGraph. The system guides learners through a sequence of defined but customizable checkpoints, verifying understanding at each step and providing Feynman-style teaching when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UPDATED: Now using Google Gemini Flash 2.5 instead of OpenAI**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "In traditional educational settings, access to personalized 1:1 tutoring is often limited by cost and availability. This project aims to democratize personalized learning by creating an AI tutor that can:\n",
    "- Provide individualized attention and feedback 24/7\n",
    "- Use your own notes and web-retrieved content as context\n",
    "- Offer patient, simple explanations of complex topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. **Learning State Graph**: Orchestrates the sequential learning workflow\n",
    "2. **Checkpoint System**: Defines structured learning milestones\n",
    "3. **Web Search Integration**: Dynamically retrieves relevant learning materials\n",
    "4. **Context Processing**: Chunks and processes learning materials\n",
    "5. **Question Generation**: Creates checkpoint-specific verification questions\n",
    "6. **Understanding Verification**: Evaluates learner comprehension with a clear threshold (70%)\n",
    "7. **Feynman Teaching**: Simplifies complex concepts when understanding is insufficient"

    "note = \"\"\"Anemia: A Comprehensive Overview\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "Anemia is a medical condition characterized by a decrease in the total number of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood. This reduction leads to a diminished ability to carry oxygen to the body's tissues, affecting overall body function and health.\n",
    "Blood Components and Their Role\n",
    "Red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, are fundamental components of blood that carry oxygen throughout the body. These cells contain hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein that gives blood its characteristic red color and is responsible for oxygen transport. The typical lifespan of a red blood cell is approximately 120 days, after which it must be replaced by new cells produced in the bone marrow.\n",
    "Types of Anemia\n",
    "Iron Deficiency Anemia represents the most prevalent form of anemia worldwide. It occurs due to insufficient iron intake or absorption, particularly affecting pregnant women, growing children, menstruating women, and individuals with poor nutritional intake.\n",
    "Vitamin Deficiency Anemia develops when the body lacks sufficient amounts of vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9). This deficiency can stem from dietary inadequacies or problems with nutrient absorption in the digestive system.\n",
    "Aplastic Anemia, though rare, presents a serious condition where the bone marrow fails to produce adequate blood cells. This form can be either inherited through genetic factors or acquired through various environmental causes or medical conditions.\n",
    "Hemolytic Anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed at a rate faster than the body can replace them. This condition may be inherited through genetic factors or acquired through various external causes.\n",
    "Clinical Manifestations\n",
    "Anemia manifests through various symptoms including persistent fatigue and weakness. Patients often present with pale or yellowish skin, experience shortness of breath, and may suffer from dizziness. Additional symptoms include irregular heartbeat patterns, frequent headaches, cold extremities, and occasional chest pain.\n",
    "Diagnostic Approach\n",
    "Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination by a healthcare provider. Blood tests form the cornerstone of diagnosis, including a Complete Blood Count (CBC), assessment of iron levels, vitamin B12 measurement, and folate level determination. These tests help identify the specific type of anemia and guide appropriate treatment.\n",
    "Treatment Strategies\n",
    "Dietary modification serves as a fundamental treatment approach. This involves increasing consumption of iron-rich foods such as red meat, dark leafy vegetables, legumes, and iron-fortified cereals.\n",
    "Supplementation often proves necessary and may include iron supplements, vitamin B12, or folic acid, depending on the underlying cause of anemia.\n",
    "Medical interventions become necessary in severe cases. Blood transfusions may be required for severe anemia, while bone marrow transplantation might be considered for cases of aplastic anemia.\n",
    "Preventive Measures\n",
    "Prevention centers on maintaining a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, particularly iron, vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin C, which enhances iron absorption. Regular medical check-ups allow for early detection and intervention.\n",
    "Certain populations require special attention regarding prevention. These include pregnant women, menstruating women, growing children, individuals following vegetarian or vegan diets, and athletes who may have increased nutritional demands.\n",
    "Potential Complications\n",
    "Untreated anemia can lead to several serious complications. These include severe fatigue that impacts daily activities, complications during pregnancy, cardiovascular problems, depression, and cognitive difficulties that may affect work or school performance.\n",
    "Clinical Significance\n",
    "Anemia often serves as an indicator of other underlying medical conditions. Therefore, early detection and appropriate treatment prove crucial for optimal outcomes. Different forms of anemia require specific treatment approaches, and regular monitoring may be necessary to ensure treatment effectiveness.\"\"\""

    "Anemia is a medical condition characterized by a deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells (RBCs) or a reduced amount of hemoglobin in these cells, which impairs the blood's ability to carry oxygen to the body’s tissues. In clinical practice, anemia is significant because it can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and shortness of breath, which may severely impact quality of life and, in severe cases, lead to life-threatening complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Anemia and Their Causes\n",
    "Iron Deficiency Anemia: This is the most common type of anemia, often caused by insufficient iron intake, blood loss (e.g., heavy menstruation or gastrointestinal bleeding), or poor iron absorption (due to conditions like celiac disease). Iron is essential for hemoglobin production, and a deficiency in iron leads to decreased hemoglobin levels, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vitamin B12 or Folate Deficiency Anemia: This type of anemia, sometimes called megaloblastic anemia, occurs due to a deficiency in vitamin B12, folate, or both. These vitamins are crucial for DNA synthesis in red blood cells. Causes include poor dietary intake, absorption issues (e.g., pernicious anemia, which is due to the loss of stomach cells producing intrinsic factor needed for B12 absorption), or conditions affecting the small intestine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hemolytic Anemia: This type of anemia is caused by the premature destruction of red blood cells, which can occur due to autoimmune diseases, genetic conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis), infections, or certain medications. In hemolytic anemia, the bone marrow cannot keep up with the rapid loss of RBCs, resulting in low RBC counts and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role of Hemoglobin in Diagnosing Anemia\n",
    "Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that binds to oxygen and transports it throughout the body. In clinical practice, hemoglobin levels are crucial for diagnosing anemia, as low levels indicate insufficient oxygen-carrying capacity. A Complete Blood Count (CBC) test measures hemoglobin levels and provides insights into red blood cell count and size, helping identify the type and severity of anemia."

      "💡 Feedback:\n",
      "The answer demonstrates a very limited understanding of anemia. The definition provided, 'anemia is a disease resulting due to iron defiency', is incorrect and too narrow. Iron deficiency is a *cause* of a specific type of anemia, not the definition of anemia itself, which is generally characterized by a reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen due to insufficient red blood cells or hemoglobin. Only one symptom ('pale skin') is mentioned, failing to meet the requirement of at least five and providing no physiological explanation for it. Furthermore, the answer completely omits any discussion of initial laboratory tests (CBC, MCV) or the morphological classification of anemia (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic), which were central components of the question and success criteria. The response lacks depth, accuracy, and coverage of the required concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 Suggestions:\n",
      "  1. Review the fundamental definition of anemia, focusing on its core characteristic: a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, often due to a decrease in red blood cell count or hemoglobin concentration, rather than a specific cause like iron deficiency.\n",
      "  2. Study the standard diagnostic criteria for anemia, such as the WHO hemoglobin thresholds mentioned in the context.\n",
      "  3. Identify and learn at least five common signs and symptoms of anemia (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, pallor, weakness) and understand the physiological 'why' behind each, relating them back to reduced oxygen delivery.\n",
      "  4. Familiarize yourself with the role of the Complete Blood Count (CBC) as a key initial laboratory test for anemia, specifically understanding the significance of components like hemoglobin, hematocrit, and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV).\n",
      "  5. Learn how MCV values are used to morphologically classify anemia into microcytic (MCV < 80 fl), normocytic (MCV 80-100 fl), and macrocytic (MCV > 100 fl) types, explaining the 'why' behind each classification (i.e., smaller, normal-sized, or larger red blood cells).\n",
      "  6. Practice explaining these concepts to a peer without notes, ensuring you cover all aspects of the question and success criteria with accuracy and detail.\n",

      "🔄 ANALOGIES & EXAMPLES:\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "  1. **Red Blood Cells as Delivery Trucks:** Think of red blood cells as small delivery trucks carrying vital oxygen (fuel) throughout your body. Anemia means there aren't enough trucks, or the trucks are empty.\n",
      "  2. **Hemoglobin as Oxygen Seats:** Hemoglobin is like the special 'seats' or compartments inside each delivery truck where the oxygen molecules sit. If trucks don't have enough seats, or the seats are broken, they can't carry enough oxygen.\n",
      "  3. **MCV as Truck Size:** The 'Mean Corpuscular Volume' (MCV) is simply the average size of your delivery trucks. This is important because it can tell doctors if the problem is with tiny trucks, normal-sized trucks, or oversized trucks.\n",
      "  4. **CBC as a Mechanic's Report:** A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is like a mechanic's diagnostic report for your fleet of delivery trucks. It tells you how many trucks you have, their average size, how much fuel they're carrying, and if they're all the same size or a mix.\n",

Anemia is defined as a significant decrease in the count of total erythrocyte [red blood cell (RBC)] mass, although this definition is rarely used in clinical settings. According to the World Health Organization, anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells (RBCs, and consequently their oxygen-carrying capacity) is insufficient to meet the body’s [...] Anemias can morphologically be classified into three subgroups as macrocytic, normocytic, and microcytic hypochromic anemias. This classification is based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of complete blood count (CBC) and aids the physician to the diagnosis and monitoring of anemias that can be easily cured, such as deficiency of vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron. [...] convenience and clinical usage. Hence, morphological classification serves to support the diagnosis and indirectly treatment in connection with the laboratory and clinic. The major limitation of such a classification is that it tells nothing about the etiology or reason for the anemia .\\n Source: https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/56750\\n',\n",
       " \"Context: In the morphological approach, anemia is classified by the size of red blood cells; this is either done automatically or on microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear. The size is reflected in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). If the cells are smaller than normal (under 80 fl), the anemia is said to be microcytic; if they are normal size (80–100 fl), normocytic; and if they are larger than normal (over 100 fl), the anemia is classified as macrocytic. This scheme quickly exposes some [...] Anemia (also spelt anaemia in British English) is a blood disorder in which the blood has a reduced ability to carry oxygen. This can be due to a lower than normal number of red blood cells, a reduction in the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport, or abnormalities in hemoglobin that impair its function. The name is derived from Ancient Greek ἀν- (an-) 'not' and αἷμα (haima) 'blood'. [...] There are several definitions of anemia. A strict but broad definition is an absolute decrease in red blood cell mass, however, a broader definition is a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen. An operational definition is a decrease in whole-blood hemoglobin concentration of more than 2 standard deviations below the mean of an age- and sex-matched reference range.\\n Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia\\n\",\n",

      "💡 Feedback:\n",
      "Your answer correctly identified that Mrs. Smith's hemoglobin level is below normal, indicating anemia. However, there are several critical areas where your response was incomplete or inaccurate. You incorrectly referred to the patient as 'the child' instead of Mrs. Smith. Your interpretation of the Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) as 'in the borderline' is vague and incorrect; an MCV of 70 fL is distinctly low, indicating microcytic anemia. You did not identify the specific type of anemia, explain the significance of the reticulocyte count, list possible causes for her anemia, or recommend further diagnostic tests with their justifications, which were all key requirements of the question. The answer also did not effectively simplify the information for a non-medical person as requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 Suggestions:\n",
      "  1. Carefully read and address all parts of the question, ensuring you refer to the correct patient (Mrs. Smith, a 45-year-old woman).\n",
      "  2. Accurately interpret all given lab values. An MCV of 70 fL is significantly low, classifying the anemia as microcytic.\n",
      "  3. Explain the significance of the reticulocyte count (0.5% in this case, which is low-normal, suggesting a bone marrow production problem rather than active destruction or loss).\n",
      "  4. Based on microcytic anemia and a low-normal reticulocyte count, list at least three plausible causes (e.g., iron deficiency, thalassemia, anemia of chronic disease).\n",
      "  5. Propose specific next diagnostic tests relevant to microcytic anemia, such as iron studies (serum ferritin, serum iron, TIBC), and explain why these tests are crucial for narrowing down the exact cause. You could also mention a peripheral blood smear.\n",
      "  6. Structure your explanation clearly for a non-medical audience, defining terms as needed.\n",

      "\n",
      "💡 KEY CONCEPTS:\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "  1. Anemia means your blood has a reduced ability to carry oxygen, often due to fewer red blood cells or less hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying part).\n",
      "  2. Red blood cell size (measured by MCV, or Mean Corpuscular Volume) helps classify anemia: microcytic (small cells, like Mrs. Smith's MCV 70 fL), normocytic (normal size), or macrocytic (large cells).\n",
      "  3. Mrs. Smith has microcytic anemia because her red blood cells are distinctly smaller than normal.\n",
      "  4. The reticulocyte count tells us how actively your bone marrow is producing new red blood cells. A low or low-normal count (like Mrs. Smith's 0.5%) in someone with anemia suggests the bone marrow isn't making enough new cells to compensate, pointing to a production problem rather than rapid loss or destruction.\n",
      "  5. For microcytic anemia with a low-normal reticulocyte count, common causes include iron deficiency anemia (lack of building material for red blood cells) or thalassemia (a genetic problem affecting red blood cell production).\n",
      "  6. Next diagnostic tests for microcytic anemia typically include 'iron studies' (like ferritin, iron, and TIBC) to check your body's iron stores and supply, and sometimes a peripheral blood smear to look closely at the red blood cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔄 ANALOGIES & EXAMPLES:\n",
      "──────────────────────────────\n",
      "  1. Anemia: Your body is a city, and red blood cells are delivery trucks carrying oxygen (fuel). Anemia means not enough trucks or not enough fuel in them, causing the city to slow down.\n",
      "  2. MCV (Red Blood Cell Size): Mrs. Smith's red blood cells are 'mini-vans' (MCV 70 fL) instead of normal-sized trucks, classifying her anemia as microcytic.\n",
      "  3. Reticulocyte Count: This is like checking the 'output' of the truck factory (bone marrow). If the roads are low on trucks (anemia) but the factory isn't producing many new ones (low-normal reticulocytes), it suggests the factory itself has a problem, not just that trucks are disappearing rapidly from the road.\n",
      "  4. Iron Deficiency Anemia: The 'mini-vans' are small because the factory doesn't have enough 'steel' (iron) to build full-sized trucks.\n",
      "  5. Iron Studies: These tests are like sending inspectors to the truck factory to check the 'steel warehouse' (ferritin) and the overall 'supply chain' (iron, TIBC) to find out why there isn't enough building material for proper trucks.\n",
